## Base URL

The DDN API adheres to REST principles and enforces HTTPS for all requests to ensure data security and integrity. HTTP requests are not supported.

All requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.discountdrugnetwork.com
```

## Authentication

To authenticate, include an `Authorization` header in your request with the `Bearer` token format, where `your_token_here` is the access token provided for your account.

```
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_token_here` with your actual access token.

## Response Codes

The DDN API uses standard HTTP codes to indicate request outcomes:

| Status | Description                                             |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 200    | Successful request.                                     |
| 400    | Parameter validation errorâ€”check that parameters are correct. |
| 401    | Missing or expired access token.                        |
| 403    | Invalid or unauthorized access token.                   |
| 404    | Resource not found.                                     |
| 429    | Rate limit exceeded.                                    |
| 5xx    | Server error on DDN's side.                             |

Refer to the Error Codes section for detailed error explanations and troubleshooting.

## Rate Limit

The DDN API has a default rate limit to prevent abuse and ensure quality of service. Each response header provides your current rate limit status, following the IETF standard.

### Rate Limit Headers

| Header Name           | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum allowed requests per rate window.                    |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | Remaining requests within the current window.                |
| `ratelimit-reset`     | Seconds until the rate limit resets.                         |
| `retry-after`         | Suggested wait time (in seconds) before making a follow-up request. |

The default rate limit allows up to 2 requests per second. For trusted users, this limit can be increased upon request.

> **Note:** If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429` response code. We recommend implementing a queue mechanism or reducing concurrent requests per second to avoid this. Contact support if you need a higher rate limit for specific use cases.
